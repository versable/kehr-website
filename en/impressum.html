        protection declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal
        data. Insofar as personal data (for example name, address or e-mail
        addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done, as far as
        possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to
        third parties without your express consent.

    <p>
        We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication
        by e-mail) may contain security gaps. Complete protection of data
        against access by third parties is not possible.

        We have not implemented cookies, but we have pretzels in our beer
        garden.
